### DATA

<p>Our major sources of data shall be the websites http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/ and https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/ .</p>

<p>We will get data about farms from the url http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/stats/census/number.htm . We shall get data about farm products by land mass from the url http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/stats/census/summary.htm . We shall then compare the volumes to the selling prices of some processed products obtained directly from the crops/livestock from the url https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1810000201&cubeTimeFrame.startMonth=08&cubeTimeFrame.startYear=1996&cubeTimeFrame.endMonth=12&cubeTimeFrame.endYear=2020&referencePeriods=19960801%2C20201201 . For some analysis, we shall use machine learning algorithms like regression to predict various outcomes, such as the prices of particular crop/livestock products and the number of farmers who will be envolved in producing particular crops or livestock.</p>

<p>We shall use the Four Square APIs, Sklearn Kmeans and Folium to study the distribution/clustering of farms in Canada and compare the findings with the above stated analysis to draw conclusions on the crops and livestock market potential.</p>
