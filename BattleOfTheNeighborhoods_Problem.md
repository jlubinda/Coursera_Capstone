### INTRODUCTION

<p>Farming is one activity we sorely need for our survival as our global population grows. More people need more food. It is that simple.</p>

<p>In the study, we focus on Canada, a country with only about 7% of land that can be farmed, and a population that has growth from 29,446,857 in the first quarter of 1996, to 36,258,726 in the last quarter of 2016. Has there been an increase in farming activities between 1996 and 2016? For one who may be interested in becoming a farmer in Canada, which areas should they expect to use for what kind of crop or livestock? Which product should he/she focus on based on economies of scale, supply and demand. We aim at bringing this data in such a way that one can easily make a decision with the backing of data.</p>
